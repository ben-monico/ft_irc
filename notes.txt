TCP makes sure data arrives as it should
IP is responsible for data routing, not data integrity

SOCK_DGRAM
Datagram Sockets dont use TCP, so data is not guaranteed to arrive. if it does, its error free tho.
They dont maintain 2way connection because its generally unimportant packets, they slap an IP and shoot.
Just like a letter. Used in Multiplayer games, streaming audio, video calls, etc.
ACK (ackowledgement) is a packet the recipient sends back to confirm he got the sender's packet.
If the sender doesnt get an ACK, resend it. In games, they just dgaf, because SPEED matters.
Encapsulate the packet in some way and hit sendto().
